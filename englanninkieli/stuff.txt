
1 (Compressed hydrogen tanks) are made from a strong but lightweight
material, such as carbon fiber. 2Currently, (these systems) carry about
5,000 pounds per square inch of hydrogen, but the goal is 10,000 psi to
improve vehicle range. 3For safety purposes, (the tank) must have a
burst strength at least twice the pressure of the fuel. 4Thus, (the tanks)
must be made from materials that are either very heavy or very
expensive. 5These tanks are also quite large, creating (packaging
problems) in the vehicles.
